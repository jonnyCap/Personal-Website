                        <p>
                            I originally attended a high school specializing in natural sciences based in Austria, Graz.
                            Fortunately we had a few opportunity adjust our school timetable and from the 5th grade on I could focus on Informatics.
                            We could choose specific courses, although some were not voluntary. However, that's were i got my
                            first insights into Web development, ECDL, Game-Programming, Network-technologies as well as Software- and Hardware
                            technology.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Transition to Armed Forces</h3>
                        <p>
                            I applied for a special IT-Eduction at the Armed Forces where only very few people got accepted.
                            Thankfully i got accepted but since i head only little experience I felt like I had to prepare myself.
                            In the course of my preparation I wanted to start learning how to code properly. So far I only programmed in
                            a Programming-Language called "Programming" which is a JavaScript-API and wanted try out something quit different.
                            So I got into Java, learned basic as well as advanced concepts and from there on I just programmed as much as
                            possible to improve my Skills.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Austrian Armed Forces</h3>
                        <p>
                            With my solid 19 years I had to join the Austrian Armed Forces to complete my basic military service.
                            As mentioned before, I was selected to be one of the few austrian "Cyber-Soldiers". At first we got special education
                            which took 2 Month. During this time we firstly learned a lot about the military, its morals, traditions and so on. And secondly
                            we got insights into subjects like Cryptography or the safe-military-network. Afterwards we were spread all over Austria again and
                            worked practically for 4 Month. In that time I worked a lot on Websites and Databases, which helped me a lot on improving
                            my Java script and SQL Skills.

                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Transition to studying</h3>
                        <p>
                            Now I had a really good grasp of what I want to do in the future and where to start if I wanted to make
                            further progress. I started a couple projects, like my first personal App or this Website. Not the mention the
                            many ones who I did not finish or make public. I also was were interested in learning a lower level programing
                            language like C++ or C, but since I was also doing an internship at the time I could only scratch on the surface of
                            these subjects.

                        <p>
                            My studies have not started yet but I cant wait for it. The last years I have invested a lot
                            of time to learn by myself and hopefully guided lessons and a mentor will help my to answer the questions i could not answer myself.
                            I also made an application for an internship at my university but i haven't got an answer yet, so wish me luck!

                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Project Idea</h3>
                        <p>
                            I originally came up with the Idea of programming Games. However, after I started a few attempts
                            of creating Games in Unity with C#, I thought that at the time I would probably profit more
                            from learning Android Studios first. Since I did not have any experience of that field of work I just wanted
                            to do a simple App and started planning.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Planning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Coming up with an creative and not completely overdone Idea was actually way harder than expected.
                            Especially rather simple Ideas were to find everywhere and I could not come up with anything new.
                            But after a few days of thinking and casually living my Life, it clicked. A friend group of mine was playing
                            volleyball a lot and we always had issues making teams. No one really wanted to choose who they want to play with
                            so an App would be optimal to solve that problem for us. So all I wanted was a simple App that creates a specific
                            amount of fairer Teams. So I started Planning and writing down everything on paper first...
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Learning Android Studio</h3>
                        <p>
                            The planning stage was done really quickly, since the app was not complex at all and I had a pretty clear
                            Idea what it should look like. Everything that had to be done now was to convert my idea to an actual app
                            and to do so I decided to use Android Studio in Combination with Java. I used Youtube as my main source and
                            for a couple of days I just started creating and developing new app-projects to test out the features and learn the core functions. Although
                            I felt like there was still a lot to learn, I decided to start with my App and continue my learning Journey by
                            mainly doing.

                        <p>
                            Despite the only few functions my app had, it took me quiet a while to finish it. Especially at the end a lot of
                            fine tuning had to be done which took a lot of time. In the end of the day it was absolutely worth it however, since
                            it was such a satisfaction. Here are some preview pictures of it:

                        <p>
                            The final step was to publish my App in the Google Play Store. To be honest I underestimated by far how
                            much effort this would be going to require. I setup my Google Player Store Account, payed the fee, uploaded my App, which
                            I than had to rework an additional 5 times because some requirements were not met and finally provide a ton of
                            information. Unfortunately, I had to postpone my Publication, because you have to host a <a href="">Privacy Police</a>
                            on your web page. At that time this Web-page was about to be made and if you can read this, my App is hopefully published already!

                        <p>
                            Well the first time I thought about a Web-page was at my time at the Austrian Armed Forces. In that
                            particular time I was almost exclusively working with Java script and overall Web-development. I was tasked
                            to develop the new intern Website for our department but due to some organizational troubles I never came to
                            publish it or neither show it to my supervisors. Therefore, I decided to save my written Code, reworked it a little and use it for my personal
                            Web-page instead. It looked somewhat like this:
                        </p>
                        <div class="secondaryContentImageContaner">

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Although initially I was quite happy with it, but after a while it just looked boring and I
                            decided to cancel the project and started from scratch.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Inspiration</h3>
                        <p>
                            My initial inspiration for the Web design came from my Logo, which I just casually created using an online
                            Logo-Designer. Since I did not want to pay for it tho, I just designed one myself in Gimp and used the colors
                            as Guideline for my Web-page.

                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Outcome</h3>
                        <p>
                            I did not have a clear plan and just started working, which probably weren't the smartest move
                            but it worked out quite well as I believe! I tried to make a cool interactive Web-page with plain Java script,
                            which was challenging at times. In hindsight I probably should have used this project to learn new Libraries like React
                            but it still helped me again to improve my Understanding of Java script.

                            A little and honestly really crappy Java script-Game-Collection!</br>
                            I designed and programmed these Games during my time at the Austrian Armed Forces and they honestly helped my a lot to understand the
                            programming language.</br>I will release these Games in an other repository.

                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Snake</h3>
                        <p>
                            This was the first Game I programmed with Java script. At the time I was completely unfamiliar with the language
                            and thats the reason why I did not use anything like Canvas or other mostly helping stuff. I simply used a grid filled with colored Divs to display
                            the background as well as the snakes Body. Every tail-Div is saved in an array and all that happens is a interval which calls
                            a function every 10 milliseconds to draw everything black except the divs saved in the array.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Flappy Birds</h3>
                        <p>
                            This Game is where I wanted to start experiencing with a randomly created Surrounding, Object-collision and gravity. I did not completely finish this Game however
                            and the gravitational forces and the graphics felt rather unsatisfying to be honest.

                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Builder</h3>
                        <p>
                            Builder allows you to place a view Divs with given forms wherever on the screen. Then you could pick them up and replace them
                            somewhere else. This game helped in particular to get a sense of the relative locations of each divs and how to combination that with
                            the mouse-X and mouse-Y position. This was rather a test tho and could not be called a real game.

                        <p>
                            This game is the first game created with HTML canvas but there is not much I want to show here because there is definitely going to be a completely
                            reworked version released of this Game.This is the only Game on here I actually put some thought and effort into it.

                        <p>
                            My probably most burdensome and elaborate Game, but unfortunately while sending the files to my PC
                            if forget two essential ones and now the Game does not work anymore. Sadly I was too lazy to recreate them.
