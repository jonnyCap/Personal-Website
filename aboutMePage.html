                            As you might know my Name is Jonathan Maier and I am a Software Developer. Im born on 18th of November in 2002, thus almost 20 years old and currently studying
                            "Software Engeneering and Managment" at the Technical University Graz.<br /><br /> I attented an heavily sience based High School where contradictly my interst in Software Engeeniring was enlightend.
                            However, my School did not have great possibilities to get into that topic, so im proceeding to learn about it since I am 15. I quickly realised how incomprehensible large the field of Computer Science was
                            and I had a truly tough time to get into it.<br /><br /> As the years passed however, I was lucky to meet awesome People who shared their interests and knowledge with me,
                            so I could get a hunch of what was going on in the amzing Aria of Computer Science. Till this day I continue to learn und try new Things. Im still at the beginning of my journy!
