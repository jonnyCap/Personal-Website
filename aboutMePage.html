                        <p>
                            I originally attended a high school specializing in natural sciences based in Austria, Graz.
                            Fortunately, we had a few opportunities to adjust our school timetable, which allowed me to shift my focus towards Informatics.
                            We could choose specific courses, although some were not voluntary. However, that's where I got my
                            first insights into Web development, ECDL, Game-Programming, Network-technologies as well as Software- and Hardware
                            technology.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Transition to Armed Forces</h3>
                        <p>
                            After high school I applied for a special IT-Eduction at the Armed Forces where only very few people got accepted.
                            Thankfully, I got given a chance but since I had only little experience I felt like I had to prepare myself.
                            In the course of my preparation I started learning how to code properly. At that point I only programmed in
                            in a JavaScript-API and therefore I wanted to try out something different.
                            So I ended up with Java, learned the basic as well as advanced concepts and from there on I just programmed as much as
                            possible to get used to the language and its features.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Austrian Armed Forces</h3>
                        <p>
                            A year after my graduation I had to join the Austrian Armed Forces to complete my basic military service.
                            As mentioned before, I was selected to be one of the few austrian "Cyber-Soldiers". At first we underwent a special training and schooling
                            which took 2 Months. During this time we firstly learned a lot about the military, its morals, rules and so on. And secondly
                            we got insights into more IT-related subjects like Cryptography or the safe-military-network. Afterwards we were spread all over Austria again and
                            worked practically for 4 Months. In that time I worked a lot on Websites and Databases, which helped me a lot on improving
                            my JavaScript- and SQL-Skills.

                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Transition to studying</h3>
                        <p>
                            Now I had a really good grasp of what to learn and where to start if I wanted to make
                            further progress. I started a couple projects, like my first personal App or this Website. Not to mention the
                            many ones which I did not finish or make public. I also was very interested in learning a lower level programing
                            language like C++ or C, but since I was also doing an internship at the time I could only scratch on the surface of
                            these languages.

                        <p>
                            My studies start at October, 2022. The last years I have invested a lot
                            of time to learn by myself and hopefully some guided lessons and a curriculum will help my to answer the questions i could not answer myself.
                            I also made an application for an internship at my university but I haven't received an answer yet, so wish me luck! :D

                        <p>
                            I originally came up with the Idea of programming Games. However, after I started a few attempts
                            in Unity with C#, I thought that at the time I would probably profit more
                            from learning Android Studios first. Since I did not have any experience in that field of work I just wanted
                            to do a simple App and started planning.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Planning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Coming up with an creative and not completely overdone Idea was actually way harder than expected.
                            Especially rather simple Ideas were to find everywhere and I could not come up with anything new.
                            However, after a few days it clicked when a friend group of mine was playing
                            volleyball we had some bad issues making fair teams. No one really wanted to choose who they want to play with
                            and I thought an App would be optimal to solve that problem for us. So all I wanted was a simple App that creates a specific
                            amount of fairer Teams. So I started planning and writing down everything on paper first...
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Learning Android Studio</h3>
                        <p>
                            The planning stage was done really quickly, since the app was not complex at all and I had a pretty clear
                            Idea of its design. I decided to use Android Studio in Combination with Java and turn my Idea into reality. I used YouTube as my main source and
                            for a couple of days I just started creating and developing new app-projects to test out the features and learn the core functions of the IDE. Although
                            there was still a lot to learn, I decided to get started with the App and continue my learning-journey by
                            just doing.

                        <p>
                            Despite the only few functions my app had, it took me quite a while to finish it. Especially at the end a lot of
                            fine tuning had to be done. However, in the end of the day it was absolutely worth it, since
                            it was such a satisfaction when I was finally done. Here are some preview pictures of it:

                        <p>
                            The final step was to publish my App in the Google Play Store. To be honest I underestimated how
                            much effort this would be going to require. I setup my Google Player Store Account, payed the fee and uploaded my App. I thought I should be done here but
                            I had to rework the App additional 5 times because some requirements were not met. When I was finally done, I unfortunately had to postpone my Publication, because you are required to host a Privacy Policy
                            on your web-page. At that time there was no web-page, so I started a new Project - Creating a Personal Website.

                        <p>
                            Well the first time I thought about a Web-page was at my time at the Austrian Armed Forces. In that
                            particular time I was mostly working with JavaScript and overall involved in Web-development. I was tasked
                            to develop the new intern Website for our department but due to some organizational troubles I never came to
                            publish it or neither show it to my supervisors. Therefore, I decided to save my written Code, reworked it a little and tried to use it for my personal
                            Web-page instead. It looked somewhat like this:
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Although initially I was quite happy with it, after a while it just looked boring and I
                            decided to cancel the project and started from scratch.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Inspiration</h3>
                        <p>
                            My initial inspiration for the Web design came from my Logo, which I just casually created using an online
                            Logo-Designer. Since I did not want to pay for it tho, I just designed one myself in Gimp, inspired by the one I made previously and used the colors
                            as Guideline for my Web-page.

                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Outcome</h3>
                        <p>
                            I did not have a clear plan and just started working, which probably weren't the smartest move
                            but it worked out quite well as I believe! I tried to make a cool interactive Web-page with plain JavaScript,
                            which was challenging at times. In hindsight I probably should have used this project to learn new Libraries like React or AngularJS
                            but it still helped me massively improving my Understanding of JavaScript.

                            A little and honestly really crappy JavaScript-Game-Collection!</br>
                            I designed and programmed these Games during my time at the Austrian Armed Forces and they honestly helped my a lot to understand the
                            basics of JS

                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Snake</h3>
                        <p>
                            Snake was the first Game I programmed with JavaScript. At the time I was completely unfamiliar with the language
                            and thats the reason why I did not use anything like Canvas or other helping frameworks or libraries. I simply made a grid filled with colored Divs to display
                            either the background or the snakes Body. Every tail-Div is saved in an array and every few milliseconds a function is called which
                            which paints all divs black except the divs reserved for the snakes body which are painted green.
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Flappy Birds</h3>
                        <p>
                            This Game is where I wanted to start experimenting with a randomly created Surrounding, Object-collision and gravity. I did not completely finish this Game and when I stopped working on this game
                            the gravitation and the graphics felt rather unsatisfying to be honest.
                        </p>
                        <div class="secondaryContentImageContaner">

                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Builder</h3>
                        <p>
                            Builder allows you to place forms, in different shapes and sizes wherever on the screen. Then you could pick them up and replace them
                            somewhere else. This game helped particularly in getting a sense of the relative locations of each divs and how to combine that with
                            the mouse-X and mouse-Y position. This was rather a test tho and could not seriously be called a real game.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">World Runner</h3>
                        <p>
                            This game is the first game created with HTML-canvas but there is not much I want to share here because there is probably going to be a completely
                            reworked version of this Game. This is probably the Game I put the most thought and effort into.
                            The simple Idea: You run around a 2D world, which is extremely minimalistic. Thats all I am going to say so far:).<br/>
                            If you are interested in the Game you can sign up for News in the Footer!

                        <p>
                            Another Game I worked on was Tic Tac Toe. Unfortunately, during the process of saving the files I somehow forgot these ones and thats why I have no access
                            to the Game no more.

                            elsewhere and it will be removed from the distribution-list after a 5-year period. If you want it to be removed sooner, you can just write a personal email
                            and I will comply your request as soon as possible.
