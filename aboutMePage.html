                        <p>
                            I originally attended a high school specialising in natural sciences based in Austria, Graz.
                            Fortunatly we had a few opportunity adjust our school timetable and from the 5th grade on I could focus on Informatics.
                            We could choose specific courses, allthough some were not voluntary. However, that's were i got my
                            first insights into Webdevelopment, ECDL, Game-Programming, Network-technologie as well as Software- and Hardware
                            technologie.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Transition to Armed Forces</h3>
                        <p>
                            I apllied for a special IT-Eduction at the Armed Forces where only very few people got accepted.
                            Thankfully i got accepted but since i head only little experience I felt like I had to prepare myself.
                            In the course of my preperation I wanted to start learning how to code properly. So far I only programmed in
                            a Programming-Language called "Programming" which is a JavaScript-API and wanted try out something quit different.
                            So I got into Java, learned basic as well as advanced concepts and from there on I just programmed as much as
                            possible to improve my Skills.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Austrian Armed Forces</h3>
                        <p>
                            With my solid 19 years I had to join the Austrian Armed Forces to complete my basic military service.
                            As mentioned before, I was selected to be one of the few austrian "Cyber-Soldiers". At first we got special education
                            which took 2 Month. During this time we firstly learned a lot about the military, its morals, traditions and so on. And secondly
                            we got insights into subjects like Cryptography or the safe-military-network. Afterwards we were spread all over Austria again und
                            worked practically for 4 Month. In that time I worked a lot on Websites and Databases, which helped me a lot on improving
                            my Javascript and SQL Skills.

                        </p>
                        <h3 class="secondaryContentTextHeader">Transition to studying</h3>
                        <p>
                            Now I had a really good grasp of what I want to do in the future and where to start if I wanted to make
                            further progress. I started a couple projects, like my first personal App or this Website. Not the mention the
                            many ones who I did not finish or make public. I also was were interested in learning a lower level programing
                            language like C++ or C, but since I was also doing an internship at the time I could only scratch on the surface of
                            these subjects.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My studies have not started yet but I cant wait for it. The last years I have invested a lot
                            of time to learn by myself and hopefully guided lessons and a mentor will help my to answer the questions i could not answer myself.
                            I also made an apllication for an internship at my university but i havent got an awnswer yet, so wish me luck!

                            However, my School did not have great possibilities to get into that topic, so im proceeding to learn about it since I am 15. I quickly realised how incomprehensible large the field of Computer Science was
                            and I had a truly tough time to get into it.<br /><br /> As the years passed however, I was lucky to meet awesome People who shared their interests and knowledge with me,
                            so I could get a hunch of what was going on in the amzing Aria of Computer Science. Till this day I continue to learn und try new Things. Im still at the beginning of my journy!
